						<h2>GO DIGITAL, CHANGE YOUR DISTRICT FOREVER</h2>
						<p> So you've been hearing all this talk about Digital 1:1 learning and the new digital revolution.  You are ready to take your school district digital too...or are you?  Going digital is a major undertaking that will fundamentally change your district forever.  So you have to make sure you're ready to do it.  That's where we come in.  Our digital learning experts will conduct a Readiness Assessment to help you determine if they are truly ready to go digital - and if not, what it is going to take to get you there.  This assessment includes a survey of parents, students, teachers, administrators, and district leadership as well as an audit of the existing technology infrastructure and ability to support a digital conversion.  </p>
