                    <h2 class="section-title">Development of Technology Plans</h2>
                    
                    <p>Once you're ready to go digital, the first and most important step is the development of an effective Technology Plan.  This will be your guide for taking your district digital.  Your Technology Plan will identify clear goals and a realistic strategy for using technology to improve learning.  It will also lay out your Professional Development strategy to ensure your faculty and staff are equipped to do take on the digital learning environment.  In addition to all of this, your plan will include a needs assessment of your current technology infrastructure and services as well as an evaluation process to monitor your progress as you take on the digital conversion.  Your plan will impact how much federal money you have access to through programs like E-Rate and will play a major role in how successful your district will be at effectively and efficiently making the digital leap.  Lucky for you, our experts are here to help you make sure this is done right.  We will oversee the entire process of developing a Technology Plan and work with your team to make sure the process is as painless as possible!</p>
