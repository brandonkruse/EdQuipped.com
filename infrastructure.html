                    <p>Designing a network is a precise science...especially when it comes to the unique needs of a school building.  We will design a network to meet your students' needs, but also do it as efficiently and cost effective as possible.</p>	
                     
                    <h2 class="section-title">Network Hardware, Installation, and Management</h2>
                    
                    <p>Once the network has been designed, the next step is to handle provisioning and installing all the hardware.  Routers, switches, access points, cabling, servers, etc...we handle it all for you.  Making the process of installing the network as painless as possible.  We also provide on-going network management that includes easy to use dashboards for school administrators and IT departments to use to track usage, control access, and other network management functions...all made simple!  </p>	
                           
                    <h2 class="section-title">Device Selection, Provisioning, and Management</h2>
                    
                    <p>So you've decided to provide district controlled devices to all your students...but wait, now you need to select which devices to use, set-up those devices, distribute those devices, and manage them once the students start using them!  That's a major undertaking, right?  Not with EDquipped.  We handle all that for you.  We will help you select the right devices for the right students, handle all the device set-up and provisioning, and manage those devices through a cloud based management system.  Easy! </p>

						<h2>GO DIGITAL, CHANGE YOUR DISTRICT FOREVER</h2>
						<p> So you've been hearing all this talk about Digital 1:1 learning and the new digital revolution.  You are ready to take your school district digital too...or are you?  Going digital is a major undertaking that will fundamentally change your district forever.  So you have to make sure you're ready to do it.  That's where we come in.  Our digital learning experts will conduct a Readiness Assessment to help you determine if they are truly ready to go digital - and if not, what it is going to take to get you there.  This assessment includes a survey of parents, students, teachers, administrators, and district leadership as well as an audit of the existing technology infrastructure and ability to support a digital conversion.  </p>
